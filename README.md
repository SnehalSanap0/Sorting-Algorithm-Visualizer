# Sorting Algorithm Visualizer

Welcome to the Sorting Algorithm Visualizer! This project provides a graphical interface to visualize various sorting algorithms. It's a great tool for understanding how different sorting algorithms work and how they compare in terms of performance.

## Features

- **Interactive Interface:** Choose the number of bars, their size, and the sorting algorithm to visualize.
- **Multiple Sorting Algorithms:** Visualize various sorting algorithms including Bubble Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort, and Selection Sort.
- **Customization Options:** Set the minimum and maximum values for the bars.
- **Adjustable Speed:** Control the speed of the sorting visualization.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

### Installation

**Download the Repository:**
   - Download the entire repository as a zip folder and extract it to your desired location.
     
### Running the Visualizer

1. **Navigate to the Repository Folder:**
   - Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you extracted or cloned the repository.

2. **Run the Python File:**
   - Execute the main Python file (GUI) to start the visualizer.

3. **Use the Interface:**
   - A window will open where you can select various parameters:
     - **Number of Bars:** Choose the number of bars to sort.
     - **Size of Bars:** Adjust the size of the bars.
     - **Sorting Algorithm:** Select the sorting algorithm you want to visualize.
     - **Speed:** Set the speed of the visualization.
     - **Min Value and Max Value:** Set the minimum and maximum values for the bars.

## How It Works

1. **Select Parameters:** Use the interface to select the number of bars, size, sorting algorithm, and other parameters.
2. **Visualize Sorting:** Once you've set your parameters, start the visualization to see the sorting algorithm in action.
3. **Adjust Speed:** You can adjust the speed of the visualization to better observe how the algorithm works.
